0x00. AirBnB clone - The console

The goal of this project is to deploy on our server a simple copy of the AirBnB website.

We wonâ€™t implement all the features, only some of them to cover all fundamental concepts of the higher level programming track.

Our application will be composed by:

A command interpreter to manipulate data without a visual interface, like in a Shell
A website that shows the final: static and dynamic
A database or files that store data
An API that provides a communication interface between the front-end and our data
ðŸ–¥ The command interpreter
Execution
The command interpreter can be launched in interactive or non-interactive mode as follows:

Interactive Mode: $ ./console.py
Non-interactive Mode: $ echo <command> | ./console.py
Usage
The command interpreter currently handles:

all [class_name] - prints all string representation of all instances (or of the specified class_name)
Can also be used as <class_name>.all()
create <class_name> - creates a new instance of BaseModel, saves it and prints the id
<class_name>.count() - prints the number of instances of a class
destroy <class_name> <id> - deletes an instance
Can also be used as <class_name>.destroy(<id>)
quit OR âŒƒ + D (EOF) - exits the program
show <class_name> <id> - prints the string representation of an instance
Can also be used as <class_name>.show(<id>)
update <class_name> <id> <attribute_name> <attribute_value> - updates an instance by adding or updating attribute
Can also be used as <class_name>.update(<id>, <attribute_name>, <attribute_value>) OR <class_name>.update(<id>, <dictionary_representation>)
Example of use.
